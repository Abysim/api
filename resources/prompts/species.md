Strictly classify wild cat species into JSON using the following rules:
1. Allowed Species List:
    - `lion`
    - `white lion`
    - `tiger`
    - `white tiger`
    - `leopard`
    - `jaguar`
    - `cheetah`
    - `king cheetah`
    - `panther`
    - `irbis`
    - `puma`
    - `lynx`
    - `ocelot`
    - `caracal`
    - `serval`
    - `neofelis`
2. Species Mapping:
    - Translations and Synonyms:
        - Map translations and synonyms to the allowed species.
            - Examples:
                - `рись` → `lynx`
                - `барс` → `irbis`
                - `кугуар` → `puma`
                - `димчаста пантера` → `neofelis`
                - `флоридська пантера` → `puma`
    - Unlisted Subspecies or Variants:
        - Map unlisted subspecies or regional variants to the main species.
            - Examples:
                - `sumatran tiger` → `tiger`
                - `barbary lion` → `lion`
        - Do not include unlisted subspecies or variants as separate entries.
    - Listed Variants:
        - Include all listed variants (e.g., `white tiger`, `king cheetah`) as separate entries if mentioned.
3. Melanistic Species Mapping:
    - Panther Mapping:
        - Map any melanistic (all-black) wild cat variants (e.g., "black jaguar", "black leopard") to `panther`.
        - Use `panther` only for melanistic variants of allowed species.
4. Binomial Nomenclature Handling:
    - Species Identification:
        - Exclude genus names when they appear as part of binomial nomenclature (e.g., `Panthera tigris`).
        - Only classify the species part if it corresponds to an allowed species.
            - Examples:
                - `Panthera tigris` → `tiger`
                - `Panthera uncia` → `irbis`
        - Do not classify the genus as a species.
            - Example:
                - Do not classify `Panthera` as `panther` when it refers to the genus itself.
5. Exclusions:
    - Metaphor and Symbolic Usage Exclusion:
        - Indicators of Exclusion:
            - Phrases indicating metaphorical or symbolic usage, such as:
                - "symbolizes", "represents", "as a [species]", "inspired by", "depicts", "embodies"
                - "pattern", "emblem", "print", "design", "motif", "style", "fashion"
                - "figure", "figurative", "abstract", "adjectival usage", "compound noun"
            - Contexts related to:
                - Fashion, clothing, accessories (e.g., "leopard print dress", "tiger-striped shirt")
                - Patterns or designs (e.g., "cheetah pattern", "ocelot motif")
                - Organizations, teams, brands, vehicles, locations, or projects with animal names but unrelated to actual animals (e.g., "Team Panthers", "Cheetah Software")
                - Metaphorical expressions or idioms (e.g., "strong as a lion", "tiger mother")
        - Exclusions:
            - Exclude sentences where the species is mentioned in the above contexts.
            - Do not count sentences that refer to the species in a symbolic, metaphorical, or design-related manner.
    - Non-Real Animal References:
        - Exclude mentions related to fictional or mythical contexts where the species does not represent a real animal.
        - Examples:
            - Symbolic uses in astrology, mythology, or dream interpretation.
            - Fictional representations without real-world counterparts.
6. Contextual References and Inferences:
    - Contextual Inclusion:
        - Include sentences that are clearly about an allowed species, even if the species name is not directly mentioned, provided that the context unambiguously refers to that species.
        - Consider descriptions of behaviors, characteristics, habitats, or activities unique to the species.
            - Examples:
                - A sentence describing a large cat with a mane that rules the savannah would relate to `lion`.
                - Mentions of a spotted wild cat known for speed would relate to `cheetah`.
    - Inference Guidelines:
        - Use contextual clues to infer the species when the description is specific and matches characteristics unique to an allowed species.
        - Ensure that the inference is reasonable and based on clear associations.
    - Important Note:
        - Do not infer species from generic terms or ambiguous descriptions that could apply to multiple species.
        - Avoid assuming species based on indirect or weak associations.
7. Scoring System:
    - Score Range:
        - From 0.01 to 1.0 (continuous range).
    - Sentence Segmentation:
        - Split input text into sentences using standard sentence tokenization.
    - Total Sentences:
        - Calculate the total number of sentences, excluding sentences in supplemental sections.
    - Relevance Check:
        - For each non-supplemental sentence:
            - Check if it is related to any species from the Allowed Species List (after applying mapping and handling rules).
            - Include sentences that directly mention the species or unambiguously refer to it through context.
        - Contextual Inclusion:
            - Count a sentence as related if it:
                - Describes behaviors, characteristics, or contexts unique to the species.
                - Continues a discussion about the species from previous sentences.
        - Exclusions:
            - Do not count sentences excluded under the Exclusions rules above.
    - Scoring Calculation:
        - For each species:
            - Score = (Number of sentences related to the species) / (Total sentences)
            - Round the score to two decimal places using standard rounding rules (round half up).
    - Supplemental Section Exclusion:
        - Exclude sentences located in sections containing supplemental triggers (e.g., `нагадаємо`, `раніше`, `також`, `крім того`, `до слова`, `окрім цього`, `додамо`, `цікаво`).
        - Supplemental sentences are not counted in total scoring.
8. Required Output Format:
    - JSON Output:
        - Include all allowed species with a score > 0 in the JSON output.
        - Format:
            - Provide the classification as JSON without any explanations and without code formatting.
            - Example: `{"[species]": [number], ...}`
        - Only include species from the Allowed Species List in the JSON output.
    - Exclusion:
        - Exclude any terms not present in the Allowed Species List, even if they appear in the text.
